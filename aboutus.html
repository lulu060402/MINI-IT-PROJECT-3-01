                    <p>Laundry struggles are real in the Hostel - waiting for machines, forgetting cycles, and dealing with crowded laundry rooms. We started DRYFANS to solve these everyday frustrations. Our mission is to bring convenience, transparency, and a touch of fun to your laundry routine.</p>
                    <p>What began as a simple idea to track machine availability has grown into a complete laundry management system that saves time and rewards users for their laundry habits.</p>
